I am a Vice-Chancellor Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, CUHK. As the principal investigator of Psychiatry and AI (PAI) Research Group, my cross-disciplinary research integrates artificial intelligence with neuropsychiatry to advance mental health science and care, while also extending to domain-free medical AI, health informatics, social computing, and AI-for-science.
