I am a Vice-Chancellor Assistant Professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Department of Psychiatry. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard-MGB's AI in Medicine Program. Before that, I received a PhD in Information from University of Michigan, School of Information (UMSI) and a BS in Statistics from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

As part of the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at CUHK, my research is dedicated to advancing Medical Artificial Intelligence and Health Informatics, with a focus on Digital Mental Health and AI-driven Psychiatry. I am committed to fostering interdisciplinary collaborations between the AI community and medical and healthcare professionals.
